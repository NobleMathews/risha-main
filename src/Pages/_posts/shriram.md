# **MS @ IITT with Dr.Sridhar Chimalakonda and RISHA Lab: A Journey of Exploration and Resilience**

I joined IIT Tirupati as a Masters student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering in the fall of 2020. Having chosen Education Technology as my research topic I joined RISHA Lab as an Research Scholar for Edtech. Little did I know the incredible journey that awaited me. It was the midst of the COVID pandemic, and as I got onboarded, I was immediately struck by the lab's diverse areas of research, ranging from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to Edtech and the application of Machine Learning (ML) in software engineering. Having previously worked as a software engineer, I was particularly fascinated by how some of my favorite software developer tools such as Postman, Chrome devtools, and Prettier might have originated from research labs like ours.

The HCI projects caught my attention in the initial days. However, as I delved deeper into the work happening, I found myself drawn to the exciting software engineering projects. The lab was dedicated to creating tools that aimed to make the lives of students, programmers, and industry professionals easier, ultimately striving to make the world a better place. Inspired by this mission, I made the decision to switch my research domain from Edtech to Software Engineering, and my supervisor was flexible and supportive of my choice.

My journey began with a project that wasn't directly related to my thesis topic but allowed me to dip my toes into the world of research. It was a stack trace visualization tool designed to assist novice programmers in understanding error messages and debugging. This project introduced me to crucial aspects of research, including scientific writing, effective presentation skills, literature review, conducting surveys, quantitative evaluation, and dealing with deadlines and the inevitable last-minute rush. Although the project didn't align with my thesis, it provided valuable insights and set the stage for my future endeavors.

As I embarked on my research journey virtually amid the COVID pandemic, the world faced unprecedented challenges. We did not shy away from these challenges but instead focused on developing technological solutions to aid people in need. We initiated projects such as an oxygen cylinder and bed availability portal and a social media platform for COVID patients to share their journeys with the world. It was an honor to contribute to both of these projects, and I even had the opportunity to lead one of them. It was a humbling experience to witness firsthand how research can be applied to address real-world problems, especially during times of crisis.

As the world began to move on from the pandemic, We finally got the opportunity to go offline! IIT Tirupati has one of the most beautiful campuses with a scenic mountain backdrop. Every day, I had the privilege of waking up to the stunning beauty of nature. I finally embarked on my thesis on energy-efficient deep learning energy patterns. The research was in collaboration with Accenture Labs. As things progressed, I encountered my fair share of lows. Research proved to be a constant battle, filled with moments of feeling lost, stuck, and directionless. The pressure mounted as I struggled to make progress and encountered countless challenges in analyzing the data collected for my thesis on energy-efficient software engineering patterns in deep learning. I would spend months studying literature, hoping to find ways to make sense of the data, only to uncover new flaws and gaps in my understanding. The cycle seemed endless.

Eventually, my supervisor would explain to me that research is a never-ending process, and we can never anticipate how our peers will react to our work unless we submit it. To illustrate this point, he would often humorously recount the story of a man going on a pilgrimage to Kashi who missed the bus because he repeatedly checked if his house was locked. The story served as a reminder to focus on moving forward instead of getting caught up in perfectionism.

Eventually, I mustered the courage to submit my first full paper, and to my delight, it was accepted on the first attempt in EASE. However, this outcome wasn't the norm for every submission. Throughout my MS journey, I encountered numerous rejections, and it was in these moments that I learned one of the most important lessons: to persist with my ideas even in the face of setbacks. Research requires resilience and the ability to embrace rejection as a part of the game. 

A common practice in the RISHA lab that I greatly appreciated was the opportunity to work on topics outside of our thesis focus. This approach allowed me to explore diverse areas and expand my knowledge beyond my primary research domain. I had the privilege of working on projects such as game antipatterns and federated learning for software engineering research. These experiences broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of different aspects of the field.

A remarkable aspect of my MS journey was the chance to present my work at international conferences. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, I had the incredible opportunity to attend two conferences to present work not directly related to my thesis (an upside of our labâ€™s culture). These conferences provided an invaluable platform to showcase my research, learn from experts in the field, and network with top-notch professionals. Attending conferences is an experience that I believe no researcher should miss, as it opens doors to new collaborations, insights, and perspectives. Moreover, I was fortunate to have both of these trips sponsored. The first trip to Cyprus was generously sponsored by the institute, and the second trip to Singapore was made possible through support from Sigsoft CAPS and Microsoft Research. 

Traveling to these conferences not only enriched my academic experience but also allowed me to explore different countries and cultures. It was an opportunity to step outside my comfort zone, embrace new environments, and engage with researchers from around the world. The exposure to diverse perspectives and approaches in research broadened my thinking and deepened my appreciation for scientific research.

Reflecting on my overall experience as an MS student at IIT Tirupati, I am immensely grateful for the unique opportunities and support I received throughout my journey. I felt fortunate to be part of such a vibrant and dynamic community. The place not only nurtured my academic growth but also instilled in me the resilience and determination necessary to overcome challenges and pursue excellence in research, and not to forget the great friends I made along the way. 

As I conclude this chapter of my academic journey, I carry with me valuable lessons, cherished memories, and an immense appreciation for software engineering research. The journey has left an indelible mark on my professional development, equipping me with the skills and mindset to continue pushing boundaries.
