# **Transformative Journey: My RISHA Lab Experience at IIT Tirupati**

My journey with RISHA Lab at IIT Tirupati began when I arrived at the institute to pursue my M.Tech degree. Little did I know that this experience would be life-changing in more ways than one.

In my first semester, I had the privilege of being taught by Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda during his Software Engineering course. His teaching style was unique and challenging. He assigned tasks that initially felt almost impossible, like reading 100 research papers in a week. However, we soon realised that these tasks were designed to enhance our fluency in skimming through research papers and extracting essential information.

One significant turning point came when he assigned a term paper as an assignment. I teamed up with Venigalla Akhila Sri Manasa, and together, we submitted the paper. Our dedication caught Sridhar Sir's attention, and he saw potential in us. This led to an invitation to join RISHA Lab, and from that moment on, there was no looking back.

RISHA Lab was a hub of creativity and innovation. We had awe-inspiring brainstorming sessions on various topics, ranging from software design and code smells to enhancing software features, developing plugins, open-source games, software documentation, human-computer interaction and educational game development.

One unforgettable experience was when there was Smart India Hackathon for undergraduates, which coincided with ICALT deadline. I obtained special permission to work through the night on my conference papers, and that rollercoaster ride resulted in submitting three conference papers in the HCI domain, all of which were accepted. It was a breakthrough moment after a long struggle to get publications as the primary author.

In 2020, I received the ACM Women Scholarship Award for above ICALT papers and had another poster accepted at ICSE. Four publications in a row was overwhelming and exciting, although the pandemic prevented me from attending these conferences in person.

Amidst these achievements, my primary focus was on my M.Tech project, which revolved around antipatterns in open-source games. This project faced its fair share of rejections, but Sridhar Sir's unwavering support and belief in our work kept us going.

After completing my M.Tech in June 2020, I joined Factset Hyderabad as a Machine Learning Engineer. Despite my full-time job, I and Sridhar Sir remained positive about the work we had done and he encouraged me to continue contributing to the research community. This led to me working on existing projects like Game Engines Dataset, BlockList, the architecture of Unreal Engine, and my own M.Tech project.

Together, we persevered, and after numerous efforts, we managed to get our work recognized at various national and international conferences, including ICSE and MSE. I am particularly proud when my M.Tech work was selected as a journal paper in the prestigious Journal of Systems and Software (JSS).

All of these achievements were possible because of Sir's consistent support and belief in our projects. I must also acknowledge the incredible team spirit of my fellow RISHA Lab members, including Venigalla Akhila Sri Manasa, A Eashan Rao, Shriram Shanbhag, and Dheeraj Vagavolu. They were always supportive and played a crucial role in our collective success.

Lastly, a heartfelt cheer goes to Sridhar Sir for creating such an inspiring and motivating RISHA Lab. He is not just a professor but a true motivator, progressive thinker, and believer. My journey with RISHA Lab has been truly life-changing, and I will forever cherish the brainstorming sessions, rigorous discussions, late-night paper submissions, and our team outings. To my RISHA Lab family, let's always stay in touch! :)
