## Learning to cope with the Unexpected

"I first started working with Sridhar sir towards the end of my second year. At that time, Sridhar sir was teaching our batch, and he gave us a glimpse of the fantastic work being done by students around the world. His motivation to make IIT Tirupati recognized as one of the top institutes for software engineering research on par with the likes of MIT and Stanford got me fired up. In addition, the effort and the variety of research problems undertaken by the lab got me motivated. Before starting my work, I mentioned that I was inspired but knew nothing about software engineering or research. Despite this, he was very welcoming and told me that everyone had to start somewhere. Hence with no knowledge of research, I started my journey with Sridhar sir and the group, which eventually got named RISHA Lab. Only a handful of undergraduate students were there initially, but undergraduate research slowly started picking up momentum in the institute, leading to more students being part of the RISHA family. 

Over the duration of my term, I got the opportunity to work on numerous development-heavy projects from diverse areas outside of my coursework, including Game Development, Software Architecture, Visualization Tools and Deep Learning. I started with development work and eventually transitioned into core research, securing few publications in esteemed conferences and the team. With the help of Sridhar sir, I secured a research internship at University of Waterloo in my third year, during which I was also offered a fully funded Masters position at the University. 

The members of RISHA Lab are like a growing family who are there to help you and push you past your limits. When I look back now, I can remember the countless full nighters we pulled together to meet deadlines and the numerous times I had to stay back in the temporary campus working together with the team. I also remember the time Sridhar sir treated us to dinner and Ice-cream after a long day. I can confidently say that my time at RISHA Lab enhanced my overall undergraduate experience at IIT Tirupati and boosted my career."

"I worked together with Dheeraj on many course projects, hackathons, and various other competitions. He always told me about the projects he was working on at RISHA Lab and publishing them at top conferences. Moreover, I also liked how Sridhar sir always pushed us to go above and beyond the regular courses. So, I joined the RISHA Lab in my fourth year to work on my BTP along with Dheeraj.

We started great on our BTP, but some of our ideas/experiments were not successful, and we had faced rejection from a conference. We then explored many different directions and read numerous research papers actively. It was a rigorous process but also a fascinating one! Every week we used to have a meeting where we spit out different ideas and evaluate the pros and cons. Thinking out of the box is one of the great things I have experienced working with Dheeraj and Sridhar sir. 

It also took some effort, in the beginning, to transition to Work from Home, but through weekly online meets, we managed to make it work and get back on track. Gradually, we learned to persevere whenever we had to change our plans quite a few times based on the results. We eventually came up with a probable solution to our problem and stuck with it, which led to a new research direction for our BTP and also for research in RISHA Lab."

"Our work was most affected when I was unable to work for most of the second half due to a medical emergency. However, I am grateful to Karthik for undertaking the complete burden all upon himself amidst all the uncertainty. We wouldn't have been able to pull through without his efforts. I am also thankful to Sridhar sir for how he dealt with the situation, which allowed me to have a stress-free recovery. Academically, we took a hit due to this unfortunate event; however, Sridhar sir pushed us to pursue this even after formally completing the BTP. We persevered day and night and finally made a publication out of our work at one of the top Software engineering conferences. I remember staying awake for the conference notification, which came around 4:50 AM, and I immediately texted sir and woke up Karthik. Through this, I experienced firsthand how working with a great and supportive team; one can tackle even the most unexpected plot twists."

##### From our experience at RISHA Lab, we have learnt that research may not always be successful; when it is not, it shows us what does not work, guiding us in the right direction. So it's either WIN or LEARN. We strongly encourage passionate students to explore the excellent work and opportunities provided by RISHA Lab.
