## OUR JOURNEY WITH RISHA LAB 

It all started in our 5th semester when we were asked to develop a mobile application for our Software Engineering course. We were clueless about everything, but with the help of Akhila Sri Manasa, who was our TA, we finally figured out a suitable project that aligned with our interests. That's when we figured software engineering is an extensive line of work with a lot of exciting topics, and it's fascinating since we'll be able to pursue any career path from that point forward.

Moving forward, in our next semester, we worked on Data-driven Requirements Engineering and even wrote a draft paper - REQKIT. Developing software solutions and aiding the software engineering community worldwide by publicizing our work is undoubtedly appealing, which piqued our interest. As a result, we joined RISHA Lab.

Our BTP work started, and as we hit the ground running, we faced many roadblocks. Some of these include the concept on which we intended to work has been published the very next week in the proceedings of MSR 2020. Hence lesson learned “Ideas will not remain novel indefinitely.” Somehow, we found our groove and published our work APIScanner at core A* conference - ICSE 2021. It was our first undergrad research publication, and the feeling was profound.


The opportunity to connect with and learn about state-of-the-art research in the Software Engineering community as an author at ICSE 2021 was only possible due to our experience at RISHA Lab. It was an excellent learning experience. The RISHA Lab's members' passion and determination have encouraged and inspired us to do our best. Sridhar sir’s advice was crucial throughout our research and writing. For my BTech project, we couldn't have asked for a better adviser and mentor.  

I vividly remember this one night we stayed up till 4:30 AM updating and finishing up demo paper draft, and sir was there guiding us through the whole night! We are grateful for all the help and pursuance we received and thankful for all the research experience and connections we’ve acquired! We wish we had spent more time physically during the last two semesters, which have only been virtual. We also miss team-outing :( 

Okay, I have to say it: Sridhar sir has a lot of patience. We once missed a couple of scrum updates, yet he kept persuading us, asking us to be more empathetic :). He always encouraged us to keep pushing our boundaries. He was there supporting us when we were lost and didn't know which direction to go or when we were too anxious or nervous to present our work with little or no confidence. 

##### To sum it up, it was a delight to be a member of the RISHA lab.
