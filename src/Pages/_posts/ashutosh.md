## Introduction to Professionalism : My stint at RISHA lab

RISHA (Research in Intelligent Software and Human Analytics ) lab led by Sridhar sir has been my happy hunting ground in the later stages of my Engineering time. My first experience with the lab was after the sixth semester. I got an opportunity to work directly with Sridhar sir on Bug Localization as a B.Tech internship project. I already had secured my internship opportunity with Bosch Engineering and Research Solutions, Bangalore. However, due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, I could not continue with the company. Sridhar sir was supportive during that phase and offered me to work with him. During my interactions with sir before the internship, I had already figured out that he was really ambitious and passionate about the work being done in the lab. Even in the curriculum courses including the labs, he expected us to do our very best and push our limits. Therefore I knew that I had to be at my very best during the internship.

During the initial phase of my internship, sir helped me to get accustomed to the project and the workflow within the lab. I was handed the task of conducting research and experimenting to improve the results of a Neural network that was trained and tested on large-scale datasets. This project was supported by Bosch labs and hence I got an opportunity to communicate with industry experts in the Machine learning field. All in all, I got to learn a lot in this project and was satisfied with my work. Taking this experience into account, I decided to continue my association with RISHA lab for my B.Tech project.

We conducted extensive empirical research during the early stages of the project to explore different research problems. As a result of this, we came up with several important topics that could be explored. We finally chose “Source code summarization” to work upon. This topic has been widely explored in the past. However, we found out that even after years of research, the state-of-the-art automated summarization tools could not deliver satisfactory results. Most of the research work in this field was directed at analyzing the source code files statically. The information associated with the execution trace of the program could be added to the automatically generated summaries. However, throughout this project, we were never limited to just the notion of dynamic analysis of source code. One primary characteristic of work at RISHA lab is that we always look out for new ideas and are open to accepting changes at any stage for the betterment of the project. A testament to the dynamic nature of work at RISHA lab is the development of supporting projects to the main project. For example, we developed a code learning assistance tool - Observe and Code. The tool provided novice programmers with incomplete code along with some hints and descriptions. These hints were extracted by using the main theme of our B.Tech project (i.e. Dynamic Code Analysis). The novice programmers then completed the code using the hints. The completed code was then compared with base code not just syntactically but also by monitoring the changes incurred on the program stack due to each line of code. We also explored the idea of static code summarization using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). We developed an encoder-decoder framework with an attention mechanism to translate code snippet input vectors to natural language descriptions. However, we could not achieve acceptable results with our model. Sridhar sir was always supportive of all our experiments. He encouraged us to improve even when we were not getting good results. Whenever our experiments failed, he used to say, “At least we now know what not to do and this can be a good knowledge for carrying our work ahead”. 

The work in the lab revolves around top international research conferences. Each and every work is aligned such that it can be presented to these conferences. Special attention is paid to the research part of any project. Every step and advancement in the project is well documented. Sir encourages each team to prepare a research paper draft for every work and asks us to update the draft as the project advances. For our project, we presented papers to three conferences - New Ideas and Emerging Results track at ICSE 2021, Demonstrations track at ICSE 2021 and Demonstrations track at FSE 2021. Our submissions in these conferences go through rigorous rounds of modifications till literally the last minute before the deadlines. Writing of the highest quality is expected from us for these papers. Sir personally works with us and modifies our drafts till 1-2 a.m. Even after all these modifications, if the quality of the paper does not fit the standards of the lab, the paper is not submitted in the conference. This kind of passion and professionalism sets the projects under RISHA lab apart from others. Also, the major advantage of aligning the projects with the conferences is that the work is uniformly distributed throughout the year. RISHA lab teams worked harder than other teams in the first semester and the same amount of work was done in the second semester. However other teams had to accelerate in the later stages of the semester to catch up with the minimum requirements of a successful B.Tech project. This was not the case with our teams because our work was efficiently structured and the whole plan was laid out before the start of the projects itself.

##### I will forever cherish my memories with the lab and also try to implement the learnings in my future work. One ideology of the lab that will always stay with me is “Hard work is important but what's equally important is to enjoy the journey at the same time”
