# **A Fascinating Journey of Research Through The Highs and Lows**

![My Time with RISHA Lab.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NobleMathews/risha-main/master/src/Pages/_images/Prantik.jpg)

I joined RISHA Lab in May 2021 after completing my first year of M.Tech. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my entire first year was conducted online. As a Master's student, I needed to select a supervisor for my second-year project. Given my interest in pursuing a project in Deep Learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I was faced with the decision of whom to choose.

My choice was heavily influenced by the Software Engineering course I took in the second semester. Although I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about the course itself, we were tasked with conducting an empirical study within it. During my research for this project and after attending several lectures, I discovered the intriguing field of using AI to address software engineering challenges. Also Sridhar Sir seemed one of the most active researchers in the institute. So, when the email arrived inviting master students to join the RISHA Lab, I seized the opportunity and expressed my interest. Before officially joining, I had a discussion with Sridhar Sir during which I admitted my lack of prior research experience. In response, he assured me that the only essential qualities he required were persistence and hard work (though I cannot recall his exact words, the essence of his message remained the same).

Upon joining the lab, I got to know other lab members and their respective projects. Weekly status updates were conducted to discuss the problems we were solving and the issues we encountered. Sridhar Sir provided valuable insights, suggesting new ideas and ways to integrate them into our work. An interesting aspect of the lab was the participation of undergraduate students who tackled various innovative challenges. Initially, I felt a bit of an inferiority complex, but the lab's culture encouraged learning from everyone. During my time in the lab, I significantly expanded my knowledge of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). I also gained insights into using GPUs and High-Performance Computing (HPC) for training large models, as my previous experience had been limited to smaller ML models.

One particularly impressive aspect of the lab was the collaborative effort that arose during conference submission deadlines. We worked late into the night, striving to complete manuscripts with all the necessary components and submitted them just before the deadlines. Although it was hectic, the coordination resembled a well-oiled machine.

My academic journey in RISHA Lab was marked by both highs and lows. I worked on two projects during my time: 1) Source Code Summarization using API information, and 2) API Misuse Detection in Python. The majority of my efforts were dedicated to the first project, which was eventually published in November 2022. The journey from inception to publication was a long and fascinating one, characterized by moments of joy, disappointment, and self-doubt, ultimately culminating in the pride of seeing my name in a publication.

Our primary goal was to enhance the existing state-of-the-art code summarization model by incorporating API Sequences as an additional modality. Initially, we explored RNN-based Tree-LSTM models and achieved improved results compared to simple RNNs. However, Transformer models, which represented the current state-of-the-art, still outperformed our efforts significantly. We then tried using the Transformer architecture with two modalities in an attempt to improve our model. Unfortunately, this experiment did not yield better results, and we achieved scores similar to existing models. I felt disappointed, thinking that my work had been in vain. However, Sridhar Sir encouraged me to explore other publications with negative results, instilling hope that our work could still be valuable. We then started writing the paper, and it became evident that I struggled with academic writing. Eashan, a PhD student who was also part of the lab, played an important role in refining the paper and making it worthy of submission. With the collective effort of various lab members, including Sridhar Sir, Eashan, Shriram, and Akhila, who reviewed the paper multiple times, I finally submitted my paper, which also served as my M.Tech Thesis. I completed my Master's degree in early June 2022 with no expectations of my paper being accepted.

However, one fine morning in August, I received the notification that my paper had been accepted for publication. I felt elated and remembered Sridhar Sirsâ€™ initial advice about the importance of hard work and persistence. Although I had initially doubted the value of my work when the results did not meet my expectations, I realised that everything happens for a reason. I had learned a great deal and had the privilege of meeting a wonderful group of people during my one-year stint in the lab. This experience became a crucial life lesson, reminding me to persevere regardless of the outcome.
